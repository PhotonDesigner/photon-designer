## Feedback and current state

Photon Designer is very early.

- The interface is clunky
- There are lots of outstanding Django features to add
- There are bugs to fix.

But, I'm working quickly to progress Photon Designer to its potential. We're just at the start 🚀

So, please be as direct and open as you can in your feedback. The more direct you are, the quicker I can improve Photon Designer 🙂
